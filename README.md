This guide will walk you through creating the serverless application that automatically converts your uploaded text notes into audio files you can listen to anywhere. We will follow the exact architecture from the video: an S3 bucket triggers a Lambda function, which uses Amazon Polly to perform the text-to-speech conversion.

### **Step 1: Create the IAM Role (Granting Permissions)**

![Screenshot showing IAM role creation](./Screenshot%202025-06-14%20at%2012.31.22%20PM.png)

First, we need to create a security role that allows our Lambda function to access other AWS servicesâ€”specifically, to read from S3, write logs to CloudWatch, and use Amazon Polly.

1. **Navigate to IAM:** Open the AWS Management Console and search for `IAM`.
2. **Create Role:** In the IAM dashboard, click on **Roles** in the left sidebar, then click the **Create role** button.
3. **Select Trusted Entity:**
    - For "Trusted entity type," select **AWS service**.
    - For "Service or use case," choose **Lambda**.
    - Click **Next**.
4. **Add Permissions:** We need to attach three policies to this role.
    - In the search bar, type `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` and check the box next to it. This allows the function to write logs.
    - Search for `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` and check the box. This allows the function to read the text file you upload.
    - Search for `AmazonPollyFullAccess` and check the box. This gives the function permission to use the Polly service. _(For production, you'd use a more restrictive policy, but this is fine for our project)._
5. **Name the Role:**
    - Click **Next**.
    - On the "Name, review, and create" page, give your role a memorable name, like `VoiceVault-Lambda-Role`.
    - Click **Create role**.


### **Step 2: Create the S3 Buckets**

We need two S3 buckets: one to upload the source text files and another to store the output MP3 audio files.

1. **Navigate to S3:** In the AWS Console, search for `S3`.
2. **Create Input Bucket:**
    - Click **Create bucket**.
    - Give it a **globally unique name**, like `voice-vault-notes-input-[your-initials]`.
    - Ensure the **AWS Region** is the same one you plan to use for your Lambda function.
    - Leave all other settings as default and click **Create bucket**.
3. **Create Output Bucket:**
    - Click **Create bucket** again.
    - Give it another unique name, like `voice-vault-audio-output-[your-initials]`.
    - Use the same AWS Region.
    - Leave all other settings as default and click **Create bucket**.

### **Step 3: Create the Lambda Function**

This is the core of our project where the logic lives.

![Screenshot showing Lambda function creation](./Screenshot%202025-06-14%20at%2012.44.41%20PM.png)

1. **Navigate to Lambda:** In the AWS Console, search for `Lambda`.
    
2. **Create Function:**
    
    - Click **Create function**.
    - Select **Author from scratch**.
    - **Function name:** Enter `VoiceVault-Processor`.
    - **Runtime:** Select **Python 3.12** (or a recent Python version).
    - **Architecture:** Leave it as `x86_64`.
3. **Assign Permissions:**
    
    - Expand the **Change default execution role** section.
    - Select **Use an existing role**.
    - From the dropdown, choose the `VoiceVault-Lambda-Role` you created in Step 1.
4. **Create the Function:** Click **Create function**.
    
5. **Add the Python Code:**
    
    - You will be taken to the function's configuration page. Scroll down to the **Code source** editor.
    - Delete the default boilerplate code and paste the following Python code:


- **Add Environment Variable:**
    
    - Go to the **Configuration** tab and click **Environment variables**.
    - Click **Edit**, then **Add environment variable**.
    - For **Key**, enter `DESTINATION_BUCKET`.
    - For **Value**, enter the name of your output S3 bucket (e.g., `voice-vault-audio-output-[your-initials]`).
    - Click **Save**.
- **Deploy the Code:** Click the **Deploy** button above the code editor to save your changes.


### **Step 4: Configure the S3 Trigger**

The final step is to connect your input S3 bucket to your Lambda function.

1. **Add Trigger:** In your Lambda function's page (`VoiceVault-Processor`), click **Add trigger** in the "Function overview" diagram.
2. **Configure Trigger:**
    - In the "Select a source" dropdown, choose **S3**.
    - **Bucket:** Select your input bucket (`voice-vault-notes-input-...`).
    - **Event type:** Leave it as **All object create events**.
    - **Suffix (Optional but Recommended):** To ensure the function only runs on text files, enter `.txt` in the suffix field. This prevents infinite loops if you accidentally upload to the wrong bucket.
3. **Acknowledge and Add:** Check the box that says "I acknowledge that using S3 to invoke Lambda functions..."
4. Click **Add**.


### **Let's Test It.**

Your entire "Voice Vault" system is now built. To test it:

1. Create a simple text file on your computer named `my-notes.txt`. Inside the file, write a few sentences like, "Project one is the voice vault. This project turns study notes into mini-podcasts."
2. Navigate to your **input S3 bucket** (`voice-vault-notes-input-...`) in the AWS console.
3. Click **Upload**, then **Add files**, and select your `my-notes.txt` file. Click **Upload**.
4. Wait a few seconds. This upload action triggers your Lambda function.
5. Now, navigate to your **output S3 bucket** (`voice-vault-audio-output-...`). You should see a new file named `my-notes.mp3`.
6. Click on the `my-notes.mp3` file, then click the **Download** button. Open the downloaded file to hear the audio version of your notes
